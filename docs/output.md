# nf-core/eggnogmapper: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. 

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [fetchngs](#fetchngs) - Download data from ENA/SRA 
- [MEGAHIT](#MEGAHIT) - Run assembly
- [Prodigal](#Prodigal) - Predict genes
- [eggnog-mapper](#eggnog-mapper) - Annotate genes
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### fetchngs
<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>
sra/
*.runinfo.tsv: Run information for each sample.
*.runinfo_ftp.tsv: FTP links for sample data.
*.fastq.gz: Downloaded FASTQ files.
*.fastq.gz.md5: MD5 checksum files for FASTQ data integrity verification.
*.mappings.csv: Mapping files for sample identifiers.
*.samplesheet.csv: Samplesheet files used for tracking and processing samples.
</details>
The fetchngs process downloads data from ENA/SRA. The output can be found under the sra directory.

### MEGAHIT
<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>
megahit/
megahit_out/
*.contigs.fa.gz: Compressed FASTA files containing assembled contigs for each sample.
intermediate_contigs/: Directory containing intermediate assembly files at various k-mer sizes.
</details>
[MEGAHIT](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit) performs the assembly of metagenomic data. The output is located in the megahit directory, specifically within the megahit_out subdirectory.

### Prodigal
<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>
prodigal/
*.faa.gz: Predicted protein sequences in compressed FASTA format.
*.fna.gz: Nucleotide sequences of predicted genes in compressed FASTA format.
*.gff.gz: Gene features in GFF format.
*_all.txt.gz: Comprehensive output including all predicted features.
</details>
[Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal) is used for gene prediction of prokaryotic genomes. The relevant outputs are stored in the prodigal directory.

### eggnog-mapper
<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>
emapper/
*.emapper.annotations: Annotation files containing functional predictions.
*.emapper.hits: Raw hit information from the eggNOG database.
*.emapper.seed_orthologs: Seed orthologs used for functional annotation.
</details>
[eggNOG-mapper](https://github.com/eggnogdb/eggnog-mapper) is utilized for functional annotation of predicted genes. The results are saved in the emapper directory.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
